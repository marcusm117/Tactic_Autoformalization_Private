2.1 LAWS OF COMPOSITION
A law o f composition on a set S is any rule for combining pairs a, b of elements of S to get
another element, say p, of S. Some models for this concept are addition and multiplication
of real numbers. Matrix multiplication on the set of n X n matrices is another example.
      Formally, a law of composition is a function of two variables, or a map

                                            S x S -+ S.

Here S X S denotes, as always, the product set, whose elements are pairs a, b of elements
of S.
      The element obtained by applying the law to a pair a, b is usually written using a
notation resembling one used for multiplication or addition:

                                   p = ab, a x b,    a 0 b, a + b,

or whatever, a choice being made for the particular law in question. The element p may be
called the product or the sum of a and b, depending on the notation chosen.
       We will use the product notation ab most of the time. Anything done with product
notation can be rewritten using another notation such as addition, and it will continue to be
valid. The rewriting is just a change of notation.
       It is important to note right away that ab stands for a certain element of S, namely for
the element obtained by applying the given law to the elements denoted by a and b. Thus
if the law is matrix multiplication and if a =               and b                , then ab denotes
             '7 3
the matrix           . Once the product ab has been evaluated, the elements a and b cannot
              4 2
be recovered from it.
       With multiplicative notation, a law of composition is associative if the rule

(2.1.1)                        (ab)c = a(bc)        (associative law)


                                                                                                 37
38   Chapter 2      Groups

holds for all a, b, c in S, where (ab)c means first multiply (apply the law to) a and b, then
multiply the result ab by c. A law of composition is commutative if

(2.1.2)                            ab = ba      (commutative law)

holds for all a and b in S. Matrix multiplication is associative, but not commutative.
       It is customary to reserve additive notation a + b for commutative laws - laws such
that a + b = b + a for all a and b. Multiplicative notation carries no implication either way
concerning commutativity.
       The associative law is more fundam ental than the commutative law, and one reason for
this is that composition of functions is associative. Let T be a set, and let g and f be maps
(or functions) from T to T. Let go f denote the composed map t",. g(f(t)): first apply f ,
then g. The rule
                                             g, f -^ g o f
is a law of composition on the set of maps T -+ T. This law is associative. If J, g, and h are
three maps from T to T, then (h o g) o f = h o(g o j):

                                                         hog


                                              g» f


Both of the composed maps send an element t to h(g(f(t»)).
     When T contains two elements, say T = {a, b}, there are four maps T                T:

                      i: the identity map, defined by i(a) = a, i(b) = b;
                      r: the transposition, defined by r(a ) = b, r(b) = a;
                     a: the constant function a (a ) = a (b) = a;
                      fJ: the constant function fJ (a) = fJ (b) = b.

The law of composition on the set           {i, r, a , fJ} of maps T     T can be exhibited in a
multiplication table:

                                               i     r    a  fJ
                                       i       i     r    a  fJ
(2.1.3)                                r       r     i    fJ a
                                       a       a     a    a a
                                       fJ
which is to be read in this way:
                                                          f


                                       g                 gof

Thus r o a = f3, while a o r = a. Composition of functions is not a commutative law.
                                                               Section 21   Laws of Composition      39

       Going back to a general law of composition, suppose we want to define the product of
a string of n elements of a set: a\ a 2 • • • an = ? There are various ways to do this using the
given law, which tells us how to multiply two elements. For instance, we could first use the
law to find the product a ia 2, then multiply this element by as, and so on:
                                         ((a 1 a 2 )a 3 )a 4     .
There are several other ways to form a product with the elements in the given order, but if
the law is associative, then all of them yield the same element of S. This allows us to speak
of the product of an arbitrary string of elements.

Proposition 2.1.4 Let an associative law of composition be given on a set S. There is a
unique way to define, for every integer n, a product of n elements a i, . . . , an of S, denoted
temporarily by [ai • • • a n], with the following properties:
  (i) The product [ad of one element is the element itself.
 (ii) The product [aia2] of two elements is given by the law of composition.
(iii) For any integer i in the range 1     i < n, [aj ■ ■ ■ an] = [a\• • a;][a;+i . . . an].

The right side of equation (iii) means that the two products [ai . . . a ,] and [a(+i ... an] are
formed first, and the results are then multiplied using the law of composition.

Proof. We use induction on n. The product is defined by (i) and (ii) for n        2, and it does
satisfy (iii) when n = 2. Suppose that we have defined the product of r elements when
r n — 1, and that it is the unique product satisfying (iii). We then define the product of n
elements by the rule
                                  [ai • • •an] = [ai •••an-i][an],
where the terms on the right side are those already defined. If a product satisfying (iii) exists,
then this formula gives the product because it is (iii) when i = n — 1. So if the product of n
elements exists, it is unique. We must now check (iii) for i < n — 1:

            [aj • • - an] = [ai • • ■ an^\][an]                   (our definition)
                         = ([aj • • • a,][a!+i • • • an-i])[an] (induction hypothesis)
                         = [a i ■ • • a,-]([a,-+i • •. an-i][an]) (associative law)
                         = [ai •. -ad[a(+i • •              a n] (induction hypothesis).

This completes the proof. We will drop the brackets from now on and denote the product by
a i "*•an•                                                                                           □
      An identity for a law of composition is an element e of S such that

(2.1.5)                        ea = a and ae = a, for all a in S.

There can be at most one identity, for if e and e' are two such elements, then since e is an
identity, ee' = e', and since e' is an identity, e = ee'. Thus e = ee' = e'.
      Both matrix multiplication and composition of functions have an identity. For n X n
matrices it is the identity matrix I, and for the set of maps T —> T it is the identity map - the
map that carries each element of T to itself.
40    Chapter 2     Groups

• The identity element will often be denoted by 1 if the law of composition is written
multiplicatively, and by 0 if the law is written additively. These elements do not need to be
related to the numbers 1 and 0, but they share the property of being identity elements for
their laws of composition.
     Suppose that a law of composition on a set S, written multiplicatively, is associative
and has an identity 1. An element a of S is invertible if there is another element b such that
                                      ab = I and ba =      1   ,
and if so, then b is called the inverse of a. The inverse of an element is usually denoted by
a-1, or when additive notation is being used, by -a.
      We list without proof some elementary properties of inverses. All but the last have
already been discussed for matrices. For an example that illustrates the last statement, see
Exercise 1.3.
      • If an element a has both a left inverse l and a right inverse r, i.e., if la = 1 and
        ar = 1, then l = r, a is invertible, r is its inverse.
      • If a is invertible, its inverse is unique.
      • Inverses multiply in the opposite order: If a and b are invertible, so is the product
        ab, and (ab)~l = b~l a~J.
      • An element a may have a left inverse or a right inverse, though it is not invertible.
      Power notation may be used for an associative law: With n > 0, an = a - . a (n factors),
a -n = a -1 • ■. a~i, and a 0 = 1. The usual rules for manipulation of powers hold: ara s = ar+s
and (ary = ars. When additive notation is used for the law of composition, the power
notation an is replaced by the notation na = a + • • • + a.
      Fraction notation | is not advisable unless the law of composition is commutative,
because it isn’t clear from the notation whether the fraction stands for ba-    1 or for a~l b, and

these two elements may be different.

2.2   GROUPS AND SUBGROUPS
A group is a set G together with a law of composition that has the following properties:
      • The law of composition is associative: (ab)c = a(bc) for all a, b, c in G.
      • G contains anidentity element 1, such that la = a and a l = a for all a in G.
      • Every element a of G has an inverse, an element b such that ab = 1 and ba = 1.
An abelian group is a group whose law of composition is commutative.
       For example, the set of nonzero real numbers forms an abelian group under multipli­
cation, and the set of alt real numbers forms an abelian group under addition. The set of
invertible n X n matrices, the general linear group, is a very important group in which the
law of composition is matrix multiplication. It is not abelian unless n = 1.
       When the law of composition is evident, itis customary to denote a group and the set
of its elements by the same symbol.
       The order of a group G is the number of elements that it contains. We will often denote
the order by |G|:
(2.2.1)                  I G | = number of elements, the order, of G.
                                                             Section 2.2          Groups and Subgroups   41

If the order is finite, G is said to be a finite group. If not, G is an infinite group. The same
terminology is used for any set. The order |S| of a set S is the number of its elements.
       Here is our notation for some familiar infinite abelian groups:
                           the set of integers, with addition as itslaw of composition
(2.2.2)
                           - the additive group of integers,
                           the set of real numbers, with addition as its law of
                           composition - the additive group of real numbers;
                           the set of nonzero real numbers, with multiplication as
                           its law of composition - the multiplicative group,
                           the analogous groups, where the set C of complex num­
                           bers replaces the set JR of real numbers.

Warning: Others might use the symbol JR+ to denote the set of positive real numbers. To
be unambiguous, it might be better to denote the additive group of reals by (JR, +), thus
displaying its law of composition explicitly. However, our notation is more compact. Also,
the symbol JRx denotes the multiplicative group of nonzero real numbers. The set of all real
numbers is not a group under multiplication because 0 isn’t invertible.                      □

Proposition 2.2.3 Cancellation Law. Let a, b, c be elements of a group G whose law of
composition is written multiplicatively. If ab = ac or if ba = ca, then b = c. If a b = a or if
ba = a, then b = 1.

Proof Multiply both sides of ab — ac on the left by a~1 to obtain b = c. The other proofs
are analogous.                                                                                           □
Multiplication by o f1 is essential for this proof. The Cancellation Law needn’t hold when
the element a is not invertible. For instance,
                               ' 1   r   ' i   r       ' 1    r   ' 3         '

                                         _2        _              _     i _



      Two basic examples of groups are obtained from laws of composition that we have
considered - multiplication of matrices and composition of functions - by leaving out the
elements that are not invertible .
• The n Xn general linear group is the group of all invertible n Xn matrices. It is denoted by
(2.2.4)                      G L n = {n X n invertible matrices A }.
If we want to indicate that we are working with real or with complex matrices, we write
G L n (JR) or G L n (C), according to the case.
      Let M be the set of maps from a set T to itself. A map f : T -»• T has an inverse
function if and only if it is bijective, in which case we say f is a permutation of T. The
permutations of T form a group, the law being composition of maps. As in section 1.5, we
use multiplicative notation for the composition of permutations, writing qp for q o p.
• The group of permutations of the set of indices {l, 2, ... , n) is called the symmetric group,
and is denoted by S„:
(2.2.5)           Sn is the group of permutations of the indices 1, 2, . . . , n.
42    Chapter 2       Groups

  There are n! (n factorial’ = 1 2 -3- •. n) permutations of a set of n elements. so the
  symmetric group Sn is a finite group of order n!.
         The permutations of a set {a, b} of two elements are the identity i and the transposition
  r (see 2. 1.3). They form a group of order two. If we replace a by 1 and b by 2, we see that
  this is the same group as the symmetric group 5:). There is essentially only one group G of
  order two. To see this, we note that one of its elements must be the identity 1; let the other
  element be g. The multiplication table for the group contains the four products 11, lg, g1,
  and gg. All except gg are determined by the fact that 1 is the identity element. Moreover,
  the Cancellation Law shows that gg         g. The only possibility is gg = 1. So the multiplication
  table is completely determined. There is just one group law.
         We describe the symmetric group S 3 next. This group, which has order six, serves
  as a convenient example because it is the smallest group whose law of composition isn’t
. commutative. We will refer to it often. To describe it, we pick two particular permutations
  in terms of which we can write all others. We take the cyclic permutation (123), and the
  transposition (12), and label them as x and y, respectively. The rules


 are easy to verify. Using the cancellation law, one seesthatthe six elements 1, x, x 2, y, xy, x 2y
 are distinct. So they are the six elements of the group:
 (2.2.7)              .              S3 = {1, x, x2; y, xy, x 2y }.
In the future, we will refer to (2.2.6) and (2.2.7) as our “usual presentation” of the symmetric
group S3. Note that 53 is not a commutative group, because yx*-xy.
       The rules (2.2.6) suffice for computation. Any product of the elements x and y and of
their inverses can be shown to be equal to one of the products (2.2.7) by applying the rules
repeatedly. To do so, we move all occurrences of y to the right side using the last rule, and
we use the first two rules to keep the exponents small. For instance,
 (2.2.8)       x~xy 'x 2y = x 2y x 2y = x2(yx)xy = x 2(x2y)xy = xyxy = x(x2y)y = L.
One can write out a multiplication table for 5:) with the aid of the rules (2.2.6), and because
of this, those rules are called defining relations for the group. We study defining relations in
Chapter 7.
We stop here. The structure of Sn becomes complicated very rapidly as n increases.
     One reason that the general linear groups and the symmetric groups are important is
that many other groups are contained in them as subgroups. A subset H of a group G is a
subgroup if it has the following properties:

 (2.2.9)
       • Closure: If a and b are in H, then ab is in H.
       • Identity: 1 is in H.
       • Inverses: If a is in H, then a     is in H.

These conditions are explained as follows: The first one tells us that the law of composition
on the group G defines a law of composition on H. called the induced law. The second and
third conditions say that H is a group with respect to this induced law. Notice that (2.2.9)
                                  Section 2.3     Subgroups of the Additive Group of Integers        43

mentions all parts of the definition of a group except for the associative law. We don’t need
to mention associativity. It carries over automatically from G to the subset H.
Notes: (i) In mathematics, it is essential to learn the definition of each term. An intuitive
feeling will not suffice. For example, the set T of invertible real (upper) triangular 2 X 2
matrices is a subgroup of the general linear group G L         2 , and there is only one way to verify
this, namely to go back to the definition. It is true that T is a subset of G L 2. One must verify
that the product of invertible triangular matrices is triangular, that the identity is triangular,
and that the inverse of an invertible triangular matrix is triangular. Of course these points
are very easy to check.
(ii) Closure is sometimes mentioned as one of the            axioms for a group, to indicate that the
product ab of elements of G is again an element of           G. We include closure as a part of what
is meant by a law of composition. Then it doesn’t           need to be mentioned separately in the
definition of a group.                                                                                □

Examples 2.2.10
(a) The set of complex numbers of absolute value 1, the set of points on the unit circle in
    the complex plane, is a subgroup of the multiplicative group Cx called the circle group.
(b) The group of real n X n matrices with determinant 1 is a subgroup of the general linear
    group G L„, called the special linear group. It is denoted by SL„:

(2.2.11)        SLn (JR) is the set of real n X n matrices A with determinant equal to 1.
The defining properties (2.2.9) are often very easy to verify for a particular subgroup, and
we may not carry the verification out.
• Every group G has two obvious subgroups: the group G itself, and the trivial subgroup
that consists of the identity element alone. A subgroup is a proper subgroup if it is not one
of those two.

2.3 SUBGROUPS OF THE ADDITIVE GROUP OF INTEGERS
We review some elementary number theory here, in terms of subgroups of the additive
group Z+ of integers. To begin, we list the axioms for a subgroup when additive notation is
used in the group: A subset 5 of a group G with law of composition written additively is a
subgroup if it has these properties:

(2.3.1)
      • Closure: If a and b are in S, then a + b is in S.
      • Identity: 0 is in S.
      • Inverses: If a is in 5 then -a is in S.

      Let a be an integer different from O. We denote the subset of Z that consists of all
multiples of a by Z a:
(2.3.2)                        Za = {n e Z | n = ka for some k in Z} .       '
This is a subgroup of Z+. Its elements can also be described as the integers divisible by a.
44    Chapter 2      Groups

Theorem 2.3.3 Let S be a subgroup of the additive group Z+. Either S is the trivial subgroup
{O}, or else it has the form Za, where a is the smallest positive integer in S.

Proof Let S be a subgroup of Z+. Then 0 is in S, and if 0 is the only element of S then S
is the trivial subgroup. So that case is settled. Otherwise, S contains an integer n different
from 0, and either n or -n is positive. The third property of a subgroup tells us that -n is in
S, so in either case, S contains a positive integer. We must show that S is equal to Za, when
a is the smallest positive integer in S.                                              .
       We first show that Za is a subset of S, in other words, that ka is in S for every integer
k. If k is a positive integer, then ka = a + a + ■ ■ ■ + a (k terms). Since a is in S, closure and
induction show that ka is in S. Since inverses are in S, -ka is in S. Finally, 0 = Oa is in S.
       Next we show that S is a subset of Za, that is, every element n of S is an integer
multiple of a. We use division with remainder to write n = qa + r, where q and r are integers
and where the remainder r is in the range 0 < r < a. Since Za is contained in S, qa is in S,
and of course n is in S. Since S is a subgroup, r = n - qa is in S too. Now by our choice, a is
the smallest positive integer in S, while the remainder r is in the range 0 < r < a. The only
remainder that can be in S is O. So r = 0 and n is the integer multiple qa of a.                   □
      There is a striking application of Theorem 2.3.3 to subgroups that contain two integers
a and b. The set of all integer combinations ra + sb of a and b,
(2.3.4)           S = Za + Zb = {n € Z | n = ra + sb for some integers r, s }
is a subgroup of Z+. It is called the subgroup generated by a and b because it is the smallest
subgroup that contains both a and b. Let’s assume that a and b aren’t both zero, so that S
is not the trivial subgroup {O}. Theorem 2.3.3 tells us that this subgroup S has the form Zd
for some positive integer d; it is the set of integers divisible by d. The generator d is called
the greatest common divisor of a and b, for reasons that are explained in parts (a) and (b)
of the next proposition. The greatest common divisor of a and b is sometimes denoted by
gcd(a, b).

Proposition 2.3.5 Let a and b be integers, not both zero, and let d be their greatest common
divisor, the positive integer that generates the subgroup S = Za + Zb. So Zd = Za + Zb.
Then
(a) d divides a and b.
(b) If an integer e divides both a and b, it also divides d.
(c) There are integers r and s such that d = ra + sb.

Proof Part (c) restates the fact that d is an element of S. Next, a and b are elements of S
and S = Zd, so d divides a and b. Finally, if an integer e divides both a and b, then e divides
the integer combination r a + sb       d.                                                         □
Note: If e divides a and b, then e divides any integer of the form rna + nb. So (c) implies
(b). But (b) does not imply (c). As we shall see, property (c) is a powerful tool.          □
      One can compute a greatest common divisor easily by repeated division with remainder:
For example, if a = 314 and b = 136, then
                    314 = 2-136 + 42,       136 = 3-42 + 10,    42 = 4 -10 + 2.
                                 Section 2.3     Subgroups ofthe Additive Group of Integers       45

Using the first of these equations, one can show that any integer combination of 314 and 136
can also be written as an integer combination of 136 and the remainder 42, and vice versa. So
Z(314) + Z(136) = Z (136) + Z (42), and therefore gcd(314, 136) = gcd(136, 42). Similarly,
gcd(136, 42) = gcd(42, 10) = gcd(10, 2) = 2. So the greatest common divisor of 314 and 136
is 2. This iterative method of finding the greatest common divisor of two integers is called
the Euclidean Algorithm.
       If integers a and b are given, a second way to find their greatest common divisor is
to factor each of them into prime integers and then to collect the common prime factors.
Properties (a) and (b) of Proposition 2.3.5 are easy to verify using this method. But without
Theorem 2.3.3, property (c), that the integer determined by this method is an integer
combination of a and b wouldn’t be clear at all. Let’s not discuss this point further here. We
come back to it in Chapter 12.
      Two nonzero integers a and b are said to be relatively prime if the only positive integer
that divides both of them is 1. Then their greatest common divisor is 1: Za + Zb = Z.

Corollary 2.3.6 A pair a, b of integers is relatively prime if and only if there are integers r
and s such that ra + sb = 1.                                                                      □

Corollary 2.3.7 Let p be a prime integer. If p divides a product ab of integers, then p
divides a or p divides b.

Proof Suppose that the prime p divides ab but does not divide a. The only positive divisors
of p are 1 and p. Since p does not divide a, gcd(a, p) = 1. Therefore there are integers r
and s such that ra + sp = 1. We multiply by b: rab + spb = b, and we         note that p divides
both rab and spb. So p divides b.                                                            □
      There is another subgroup of Z+ associated to a pair a, b of integers, namely the
intersection Za n Zb, the set of integers contained both in Za and in Zb. We assume now
that neither a nor b is zero. Then Za n Zb is a subgroup. It is not the trivial subgroup {OJ
because it contains the product ab, which isn’t zero. So Za n Zb has the form Zm for some
positive integer m. This integer m is called the least common mUltiple of a and b, sometimes
denoted by lcm(a, b), for reasons that are explained in the next proposition.

Proposition 2.3.8 Let a and b be integers different from zero, and let m be their least
common multiple - the positive integer that generates the subgroup S = Za n Zb. So
Zm = Za n Zb. Then
(a) m is divisible by both a and b.
(b) If an integer n is divisible by a and by b, then it is divisible by m.

Proof. Both statements follow from the fact that an integer is divisible by a and by b if and
only if it is contained in Zm = Za n Zb.                                                          □
Corollary 2.3.9 Let d = gcd(a, b) and m = lcm(a, b) be the greatest common divisor and
least common multiple of a pair a, b of positive integers, respectively. Then ab = dm.

Proof Since b /d is an integer, a divides a b /d . Similarly, b divides a b /d . So m divides
a b /d , and dm divides ab. Next, we write d = ra + sb. Then dm = ram + sbm. Both terms
4fr   Chapter 2      Groups

on the right are divisible by ab, so ab divides dm. Since ab and dm are positive and each
one divides the other, ab = dm.                                                                       □

2.4. CYCLIC GROUPS

We come now to an important abstract example of a subgroup, the cyclic subgroup generated
by an arbitrary element x of a group G. We use multiplicative notation. The cyclic subgroup
H generated by x is the set of all elements. that are powers of x:

(2.4.1)                        H = { . . . , x- 2 , x-1, 1 , x, x2 , ...} .

This is the smallest subgroup of G that contains x, and it is often denoted by <x>. But to
interpret (2.4.1) correctly, we must remember that the notation x” represents an element
of the group that is obtained in a particular way. Different powers may represent the same
element. For example, if G is the multiplicative group Kx and x = -1, then all elements in
the list are equal to I or to -1, and H is the set {I, -I}.
       There are two possibilities: Either the powers x” represent distinct elements, or they
do not. We analyze the case that the powers of x are not distinct.

Proposition 2.4..2 Let <x> be the cyclic subgroup of-a group G generated by an element x,
and let S denote the set of integers k such that x^ = 1.
(a) The set S is a subgroup of the additive group Z+.
(b) i T*yo powers xr = x*, with r :: s, are equal if and only if xr s = 1, i.e., if and only if r - s
      is in S.
(c) Suppose that S is not the trivial subgroup. Then S = Zn for some positive integer n.
     The powers 1, x, x2, •.., x” - 1 are the distinct elements of the subgroup < x >, and the
      order of < x ) is n.

Proof (a) If xk = 1 and x^ = 1, then x ^ + = xkx^ = 1. This shows that if k and t are in S,
then k + I is in S. So the first property (2.3.1) for a subgroup is verified. Also, x0 = 1. so 0 is
in S. Finally, if k is in S, i.e., x^ = 1, then x~* = (xk)-1 = I too, so - k is in S.
(b) This follows from the Cancellation Law 2.2.3.
(c) Suppose that S:;i:{O}. Theorem 2.3.3 shows that S = Zn, where n is the smallest positive
integer in S. If x* is an arbitrary power, we divide k by n, writing k = qn + r with r in the
range 0     r, < n. Then x^n = I q = 1, and x^ = x9”xr = xr. Therefore x* is equal to one of
the powers 1, x, ..., x”_i. It follows from (b) -that these powers are distinct, because x” is
the smallest positive power equal to 1.                                                        □

      The group- <x> = {I, x, ..., x"-i} described by part (c) of this proposition is called a
cyclic group oforder n. It is called cyclic because repeated multiplication by x cycles through
the n elements.,
      An, eleIl;u;p;t.x of . a group has order n i f n is the smallest positive integer with the
property xn = 1, v.(hich is the same thing as saying that the. cyclic sub group <x> generated :
by x has order n.
      With the usual presen tation of the symmetric group S3, the element x has order 3, and
y has ,order ,2: In any group., the identity element is the only.element of order 1.
                                                            Section 2.5     Homomorphisms       47


       If x n =1 1 for all n > 0 , one says that x has infinite order. The matrix      has
                                      ' 1 1'
infinite order in G L 2(K), while                has order 6.
                                        _1 1.
       When x has infinite order, the group <x> is said to be infinite cyclic. We won’t have
much to say about that case.

Proposition 2.4.3 Let x be an element of finite order n in a group, and let k be an integer
that is written as k = nq + r where q and r are integers and r is in the range 0 < r < n.
      • x k = x r.
      • x k = 1 if and only if r = 0.
      • Let d be the greatest common divisor of k and n. The order of x* is equal
        to n /d .                                                                               □

       One may also speak of the subgroup of a group G generated by a subset U. This is
the smallest subgroup of G that contains U, and it consists of all elements of G that can be
expressed as a product of a string of elements of U and of their inverses. A subset U of G
is said to generate G if every element of G is such a product. For example, we saw in (2.2.7)
that the set U = {x, y} generates the symmetric group S3. The elementary matrices generate
G L n (1.2.16). In both of these examples, inverses aren’t needed. That isn’t always true. An
infinite cyclic group <x> is generated by the element x, but negative powers are needed to
fill out the group.
       The Klein four group V, the group consisting of the four matrices

(2.4.4)

is the simplest group that is not cyclic. Any two of its elements different from the identity
generate V. The quaternion group H is another example of a small group. It consists of the
eight matrices

(2.4.5)                            H = {± 1

where
                      '1 O'      'i  0'         ' 0                "0       i"
                 1=         , I=                            1", k=
                        0 1       0 - i " - J = -1          0"     .i       0'
These matrices can be obtained from the Pauli matrices of physics by multiplying by i.
The two elements i and j generate H. Computation leads to the formulas

(2.4.6)       i2 = J2 = k2 = - 1 , ij = -ji = k , jk = -kj = i ,     ki = -ik = j.


2.5   HOMOMORPHISMS
Let G and G' be groups, written with multiplicative notation. A homomorphism cp: G -+ G'
is a map from G to G' such that for all a and b in G,
(2.5.1)                              cp(ab) = cp(a)cp(b).
48    Chapter 2      Groups

The left side of this equation means
      first multiply a and b in G, then send the product to G ' using the map <p,
while the right side means
      first send a and b individually to G ' using the map <p, then multiply their images in G'.
Intui tively, a homomorphism is a map that is compatible with the laws of composition in the
two groups, and it provides a way to relate different groups.

Examples 2.5.2     The following maps are homomorphisms:
(a)   the determinant function det: G Ln(M) -+ Kx (1.4.10),
(b)   the sign homomorphism ct : Sn -+ {±I} that sends a permutation to its sign (1.5.11),
(c)   the exponential map exp: jR+ -+ Ex defined b y x -w eX,
(d)   th e map <p:Z+ -+ G defined by <p(n) = a n, where a is a given element of G,
(e)   the absolute value map I | : CX -+ ]R.X.

      In examples (c) and (d), the law of composition is written additively in the domain and
multiplicatively in the range. The condition (2.5.1) for a homomorphism must be rewritten
to take this into account. It becomes
                                       <p(a + b) = <p(a)<p(b).

The formula showing that the exponential map is a homomorphism is              ea+b =, ea eb.
       The following homomorphisms need to be mentioned, though they are less interesting.
The trivial homomorphism <p: G -+ G ' between any two groups maps every element of G to
the identity in G'. If H is a subgroup of G, the inclusion map i: H -+ G defined by i(x) = x
for x in H is a homomorphism.

Proposition 2.5.3 Let <p:G -+ G ' be a group homomorphism.
(a) If ai, . . . , a* are elements of G, then <p(ai ... ak) = <p(ai) ■ ■ ■ <p(ak).
(b) maps the identity to the identity: <p(1g ) = Ig'.
(c) maps inverses to inverses: <p(a 1) = <p(a) l .

Proof The first assertion follows by induction from the definition. Next, since 1 . 1 = 1 and
since is a homomorphism, <p(1)<p(1) = <p(l . 1) = <p(l). We cancel <p(l) from both sides
(2.2.3) to obtain <p(l) = 1. Finally, <p(a~l)<p(a) = <p(a- 1a) = <p(l) = 1. Hence <p(a-1) is the
inverse of <p(a).                                                                             □

       A group homomorphism determines two important subgroups: its image and its kernel.
• The image of a homomorphism <p:G -+ G', often denoted by im <p, is simply the image of
  as a map of sets:
(2.5.4)                  im    = {x e G ' | x = <p(a) for some a in G ),

Another notation for the image would be <p(G).
                                                              Section 2.5      Homomorphisms        49

        The image of the map Z+ -+ G that sends n -~+an is the cyclic subgroup < a > generated
by a.
      The image of a homomorphism is a subgroup of the range. We will verify closure and
omit the other verifications. Let x and y be elements of the image. This means that there
are elements a and b in G such that x = IP(a) and y = IP(b). Since IP is a homomorphism,
x y = IP(a)IP(b) = IP(ab). So xy is equal to lP(something). It is in the image too.
• The kernel of a homomorphism is more subtle and also more important. The kernel of IP,
often denoted by ker IP, is the set of elements of G that are mapped to the identity in G':

(2.5.5)                            kerIP = {a € G | IP(a) = 1}.

The kernel is a subgroup of G because, if a and b are in the kernel, then IP(ab) = IP(a)IP(b) =
1-1 = 1, so ab is in the kernel, and so on.
      The kernel of the determinant homomorphism G L n (R) -+ jRx is the special linear
group S L n(R) (2.2.11). The kernel of the sign homomorphism Sn -+ {± I} is called the
alternating group. It consists of the even permutations, and is denoted by An:

(2.5.6)           The alternating group An is the group of even permutations.

      The kernel is important because it controls the entire homomorphism. It tells us not
only which elements of G are mapped to the identity in G', but also which pairs of elements
have the same image in G'.
• If H is a subgroup of a group G and a is an element of G, the notation a H will stand for
the set of all products ah with h in H:

(2.5.7)                     a H = {g € G |g = ah for some h in H}.

This set is called a left coset of H in G, the word “left” referring to the fact that the element
a appears on the left.

Proposition 2.5.8 Let IP : G -+ G ' be a homomorphism of groups, and let a and b be
elements of G. Let K be the kernel of IP. The following conditions are equivalent:
        • IP(a) = IP(b),
        • a -l b is in K,
        • b is in the coset aK ,
        • The cosets bK and a K are equal.

Proof Suppose that IP(a) = IP(b). Then IP(a- 1b) = IP(a-!)IP(b) = IP(a)- 1IP(b) = l.
Therefore a - lb is in the kernel K. To prove the converse, we tum this argument around.
If a -1b is in K, then 1 = IP(a-*b) = IP(a)-1IP(b), so IP(a) = IP(b). This shows that the first
two bullets are equivalent. Their equivalence with the other bullets follows.                   □

Corollary 2.5.9 A homomorphism IP: G -+ G' is injective if and only if its kernel K is the
trivial subgroup {1} of G.
50   Chapter 2       Groups

Proof. If K = {I}, Proposition 2.5.8 shows that rp(a) = rp(b) only when a~1b = 1, i .e., a = b.
Conversely, if rp is injective, then the identity is the only element of G such that rp(a) = 1,
so K = {I}.                                                                                     □

      The kernel of a homomorphism has another important property that is explained in
the next proposition. If a and g are elements of a group G, the element gag- 1 is called the
conjugate of a by g.

Definition 2.5.10 A subgroup N of a group G is a normal subgroup if for every a in N and
every g in G, the conjugate gag- 1 is in N.

Proposition 2.5.11    The kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.

Proof If a is in the kernel of a homomorphism rp: G -+ G ' and if g is any element of G,
then rp(gag~x) = rp(g)rp(a)rp(g-1) = rp(g)lrp(g) - 1 = 1. Therefore gag- 1 is in the kernel
too.                                                                                        □
      Thus the special linear group S L n(W) is a normal subgroup of the general linear group
GLn(lR.), and the alternating group An is a normal subgroup of the symmetric group S„.
Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal, because if G is abelian, then gag-1 = a for
all a and all g in the group. But subgroups of nonabelian groups needn’t be normal. For
example, in the symmetric group S3, with its usual presentation (2.2.7), the cyclic subgroup
<y> of order two is not normal, because y is in G, but xyx-1 = x      2 y isn’t in <y>.


• The center of a group G, which is often denoted by Z, is the set of elements that commute
with every element of G:

(2.5.12)                      Z = {z € G | zx = xz for all x € G }.

It is always a normal subgroup of G. The center of the special linear group SL2 (JR) consists
of the two matrices I, -I. The center of the symmetric group S„ is trivial if n :: 3.

Example 2.5.13 A homomorphism rp:S4 -+ S3 between symmetric groups.
      There are three ways to partition the set of four indices {I, 2, 3, 4} into pairs of subsets
of order two, namely

(2.5.14)             n j : {I, 2} U {3, 4}, n 2 : {I, 3} U {2, 4}, n 3 : {I, 4} U {2, 3}.

An element of the symmetric group S4 permutes the four indices, and by doing so it
also permutes these three partitions. This defines the map rp from S4 to the group of
permutations of the set { n i, n 2, n 3}, which is the symmetric group S3. For example, the
4-cycle p = (1234) acts on subsets of        order two as follows:

                         {I, 2}   {2, 3} {I, 3}       {2, 4} {I, 4}                                  {I, 2}
                         {2, 3}   {3, 4} {2, 4}       {I, 3} {3, 4} "'"{I, 4).

Looking at this action, one sees that p acts on the set { n i, n 2, n 3} of partitions as the
transposition ( n i n 3) that fixes n 2 and interchanges n i and n 3.
                                                                  Section 2.6      Isomorphisms       51

       If p and q are elements of S4, the product p q is the composed permutation p 0 q,
and the action of pq on the set { n j, n 2. n 3} is the composition of the actions of q and p.
Therefore q;(pq) = q;(p)q;(q), and cp is a homomorphism.
       The map is surjective, so its image is the whole group S3. Its kernel can be computed.
It is the subgroup of S4 consisting of the identity and the three products of disjoint trans­
positions:
(2.5.15)                   K = {l, (12)(34),      (13)(24),    (14)(23)}.                             □


2.6   ISOMORPHISMS
An isomorphism q;: G -+ G ' from a group G to a group G ' is a bijective group homomor­
phism - a bijective map such that q;(ab) = q;(a)cp(b) for all a and b in G.

Examples 2.6.1
      • The exponential map eX is an isomorphism, when it is viewed as a map from the
        additive group 1R+ to its image, the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.
      • If a is an element of infinite order in a group G, the map sending n . . a ” is an
        isomorphism from the additive group Z+ to the infinite cyclic subgroup < a> o f G.
      • The set P of n Xn permutation matrices is a subgroup of G L n, and the map S„ -+ P
        that sends a permutation to its associated matrix (1.5.7) is an isomorphism.        □

      Corollary 2.5.9 gives us a way to verify that a homomorphism q; : G            -+ G ' is an
isomorphism. To do so, we check that kerq; = {l}, which implies that q; is injective, and also
that im q; = G ', that is, q; is surjective.

Lemma 2.6.2 If q;: G -+ G' is an isomorphism, the inverse map q; - 1 : G' -+ G is also an
isomorphism.

Proof The inverse of a bijective map is bijective. We must show that for all x and y in G',
q;- l (x)q;“ l (y) = q;~l ( x y ).We set a = q;-1^ ) , b = q;_1(y), and c = q;_1(xy). What has to
be shown is that ab = c, and since q; is bijective, it suffi ces to show that q;(ab) = q;(c). Since
cp is a homomorphism,
                                q;(ab) = q;(a)q;(b) = xy = q;(c).                                     □

       This lemma shows that when q;: G -+ G' is an isomorphism, we can make a computation
in either group. then use q; or q; - 1 to carry it over to the other. So, for computation with the
group law, the two groups have identical properties. To picture this conclusion intuitively,
suppose that the elements of one of the groups are put into unlabeled boxes, and that
we have an oracle that tells us, when presented with two boxes, which box contains their
product. We will have no way to decide whether the elements in the boxes are from G or
from G'.
       Two groups G and G' are said to be isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism q; from
G to G'. We sometimes indicate that two groups are isomorphic by the symbol «
(2.6.3)                    G ~ G ' means that G is isomorphic to G '.
52    Chapter 2     Groups

Since isomorphic groups have identical properties, it is often convenient to identify them with
each other when speaking informally. For instance, we often blur the distinction between
the symmetric group Sn and the isomorphic group P of permutation matrices.
• The groups isomorphic to a given group G form what is called the isomorphism class of G.
      Any two groups in an i somorphism class are isomorphic. When one speaks ofclassifying
groups, what is meant is to describe these isomorphism classes. This is too hard to do for all
groups, but we will see that every group of prime order p is cyclic. So all groups of order
p are isomorphic. There are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 4 (2.11.5) and five
isomorphism classes of groups of order 12 (7.8.1).
      An interesting and sometimes confusing point about isomorphisms is that there exist
isomorphisms q; : G -+ G from a group G to itself. Such an isomorphism is called an
automorphism. The identity map is an automorphism, of course, but there are nearly always
others. The most important type of automorphism is conjugation: Let g be a fixed element
of a group G. Conjugation by g is the map q; from G to itself defined by

(2.6.4)                                    q;(x) = gxg-1^

This is an automorphism because, first of all, it is a homomorphism:

                        q;(xy) = gxyg -      = gxg- 1 g y g- 1 = q;(x)q;(y),

and second, it is bijective because it has an inverse function - conjugation by g -1.
      If the group is abelian, conjugation by any element g is the identity map: gxg -      1 = x.
But any noncommutative group has nontrivial conjugations, and so it has automorphisms
different from the identity. For instance, in the symmetric group S3, presented as usual,
conjugation by y interchanges x and x 2.
      As was said before, the element gxg- 1 is the conjugate of x by g, and two elements
x and x' of a group G are conjugate if x' = g x g - 1 for some g in G. The conjugate g x g -1
behaves in much the same way as the element x itself; for example, it has the same order in
the group. This follows from the fact that it is the image of x by an automorphism. (See the
discussion following Lemma 2.6.2.)
Note: One may sometimes wish to determine whether or not two elements x and y of a
group G are conjugate, i.e., whether or not there is an element g in G such that y = g x g -1.
It is almost always simpler to rewrite the equation to be solved for g as yg = gx.                   □
• The commutator aba-^b"       1   is another element associated to a pair a, b of elements of a
group.
      The next lemma follows by moving things from one side of an equation to the other.
Lemma 2.6.5 Two elements a and b of a group commute, ab = ba, if and only if aba-             1    = b,
and this is true if and only if a b a ^ b - 1 = 1.                                                   □

2.7   EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS AND PARTITIONS
A fundamental mathematical construction starts with a set S and forms a newsetby equating
certain elements of S. For instance, we may divide the set of integers into two classes, the
                                          Section 2.7     Equivalence Relations and Partitions      53

even integers and the odd integers. The new set we obtain consists of two elements that
could be called Even and Odd. Or, it is common to view congruent triangles in the plane
as equivalent geometric objects. This very general procedure arises in several ways that we
discuss here .
• A partition n of a set S is a subdivision of S into nonoverlapping, nonempty subsets:

(2.7.1)                     S = union of disjoint nonempty subsets.

The two sets Even and Odd partition             the set of integers. With the usual notation,
the sets

(2.7.2)

form a partition of the symmetric group S3.
• An equivalence relation on a set S is a relation that holds between certain pairs of elements.




      • transitive: If a ~ b and b      c , then a   c.
      • symmetric: If a ~ b , then b ~ a.
      • reflexive: For all a, a    a.
      Congruence of triangles is an example of an equivalence relation on the set of triangles
in the plane. If A , B, and C are triangles, and if A is congruent to B and B is congruent to
C, then A is congruent to C, etc.
      Conjugacy is an equivalence relation on a group. Two group elements are conjugate,
a""b, if b = gag - 1 for some group element g. We check transitivity: Suppose that a""b
and b ~ c. This means that b = giag ^1 and c = gibg ^ 1 for some group elements gi and g2.
Then c = g2(giag11 ) g ^ = (g 2 g i)a ( g2 gi)~ \ so a       c.
     The concepts of a partition of S and an equivalence relation on S                are logically
equivalent, though in practice one may be presented with just one of the two.

Proposition 2.7.4 An equivalence relation on a set S determines a partition of S, and
conversely.

Proof Given a partition of S, the corresponding equivalence relation is defined by the rule
that a ~ b if a and b lie in the same subset of the partition. The axioms for an equivalence
relation are obviously satisfied. Conversely, given an equivalence relation, one defines a
partition this way: The subset that contains a is the set of all elements b such that a ~ b. This
subset is called the equivalence class of a. We’ll denote it by Ca here:

(2.7.5)                                 Ca = {b e S | a""b}.

The next lemma completes the proof of the proposition.                                              □
54    Chapter 2      Groups

Lemma 2.7.6 Given an equivalence relation on a set S, the subsets of S that are equivalence
classes partition S.

Proof This is an important point, so we will check it carefully. We must remember that the
notation Ca stands for a subset defined in a certain way. The partition consists of the subsets,
and several notations may describe the same subset.
       The reflexive axiom tells us that a is in its equivalence class. Therefore the class C a is
nonempty, and since a can be any element, the union of the equivalence classes is the whole
set S. The remaining property of a partition that must be verified is that equivalence classes
are disjoint. To show this, we show:

(2.7.7)           If Ca and Cb have an element in common, then C a = Cb.

Since we can interchange the roles of a and b, it will suffice to show that if Ca and Cb have
an element, say d, in common, then Cb C Ca, i.e., any element x of Cb is also in Ca. If          x is

in Cb, then b ~ x. Since d is in both sets, a ~ d and b ~ d, and the symmetry property tells
us that d ~ b. So we have a       d, d ~ b, and b ~ x. Two applications of transitivity show that
a ~ x, and therefore that x is in Ca.                                                              □

      For example, the relation on a group defined by a ~ b if a and b are elements of the
same order is an equivalen ce relation. The corresponding partition is exhibited in (2.7.2) for
the symmetric group S3.                                                         _
      If a partition of a set S is given, we may construct a new set S whose elements are
the subsets. We imagine putting the subsets into separate piles, and we regard the piles as
the elements of our new set S. It seems advisable to have a notation to distinguish a subset
from the element of the set S (the pile) that it represents. If U is a subset, we will denote by
[U] the corresponding element of S. Thus if S is the set of integers and if Even and Odd
denote the subsets of even and odd integers, respectively, then S contains the two elements
[Even] and [Odd].
      We will use this notation more generally. When we want to re gard a subset U of S as
an element of a set of subsets of S, we denote it by [U].
      When an equivalence relation on S is given, the equivalence classes form a partition,
and we obtain a new set S whose elements are the equivalence classes [Ca] We can think of
the elements of this new set in another way, as the set obtained by changing what we mean
by equality among elements. If a and b are in S, we interpret a ~ b to mean that a and b
become equal in S, because Ca = Cb. With this way of looking at it, the difference between
the two sets S and S is that in S more elements have been declared “equal,” i.e., equivalent.
It seems to me that we often treat congruent triangles this way in school.
      For any equivalence relation, there is a natural surjective map

(2.7.8)                                       n:S-+S

that maps an element a of S to its equivalence class: n (a) = [Ca]. When we want to regard
S as the set obtained from S by changing the notion of equality, it will be convenient to
denote the element [Ca] of S by the symbol a. Then the map n becomes

                                              n (a ) = a
                                         Section 2.7     Equivalence Relations and Partitions     55

We can work in S with the symbols used for elements of S, but with bars over them to
remind us of the new rule:

(2.7.9)                   If a and b are in S,   then Ii = b means a     b.

A disadvantage of this bar notation is that many symbols represent the same element
of S. Sometimes this disadvantage can be overcome by choosing a particular element, a
representative element, in each equivalence class. For example, the even and the odd integers
are often represented by 0 and 1:

(2.7.10)                             {[Even], [Odd]} = {0, I}.

Though the pile picture may be easier to grasp at first, the second way of viewing S is often
better because the bar notation is easier to manipulate algebraically.

The Equivalence Relation Defined by a Map

Any map of sets f : S -+ T gives us an equivalence relation on its domain S. It is defined by
the rule a b if f(a ) = fib ).
• The inverse image of an element t of T is the subset of S consisting of all elements s such
that f(s) = t. It is denoted symbolically as

(2.7.11)                           r H t ) = {s e S I f(s ) = t} .

This is symbolic notation. Please remember that unless f is bijective, r         1 will not be a map.
The inverse images are also called the fibres of the map f , and the fibres that are not empty
are the e quivalence_classes for the relation defined above.
      Here the set S of equivalence classes has another incarnation, as the image of the map.
The elements of the image correspond bijectively to the nonempty fibres, which are the
equivalence classes.

Example 2.7.13 If G is a finite group, we can define a map j : G -+ N to the set {I, 2, 3, ... }
of natural numbers, letting f(a ) be the order of the element a of G. The fibres of this map
are th e sets of elements with the same order (see (2.7.2), for example).                        □
56    Chapter 2      Groups

      We go back to a group homomorphism ({J: G -+ G'. The equivalence relation on G
defined by ({J is usually denoted by =, rather than by and is referred to as congruence:

(2.7.14)                              a = b if ({J(a) = ({J(b).

We have seen that elements a and b of G are congruent, i.e., ({J(a) = ({J(b) , if and only if b is
in the coset a K of the kernel K (2.5.8).

Proposition 2.7.15 Let K be the kernel of a homomorphism ({J: G -+ G'. The fibre of ({J that
contains an element a of G is the coset aK of K. These cosets partition the group G, and
they correspond to elements of the image of ({J.                                           □




(2.7.16)              A Schematic Diagram of a Group Homomorphism.

2.8   COSETS
As before, if H is a subgroup of G and if a is an element of G, the subset

(2.8.1)                                a H = {ah | h in H}.

is called a left coset. The subgroup H is a particular left coset because H = 1H.
       The cosets of H in G are equivalence classes for the congruence relation

(2.8.2)                         a = b if b = ah for some h in H.

This is very simple, but let’s verify that congruence is an equivalence relation.
Transitivity: Suppose that a = b and b e c . This means that b = ah and c = bh' for some
elements h and h ' of H. Therefore c = ahh'. Since H is a subgroup, hh' is in H, and thus
a = c.
Symmetry: Suppose a = b, so that b = ah. Then a = bh-1 and h-1 is in H , so b = a.
Reflexivity: a = a l and 1 is in H, so a = a.
Notice that we have made use of all the defining properties of a subgroup here: closure,
inverses, and identity.
                                                                         Section 2.8      Cosets   57

Corollary 2.8.3    The left cosets of a subgroup H of a group G partition the group.

Proof. The left cosets are the equivalence classes for the congruence relation (2.8.2).            □
     Keep in mind that the notation a H defines a certain subset of G. As with          any
equivalence relation, several notations may define the same subset. For example, in the
symmetric group S3, with the usual presentation (2.2.6), the element y generates a cyclic
subgroup H = < y> of order 2. There are three left cosets of H in G:

(2.8.4)       H = {I, y} = yH , x H = {x, xy} = xy H , x2 H = {x2, x2y) = x2yH.

These sets do partition the group.
      Recapitulating, let H be a subgroup of a group G and let a and b be elements of G.
The following are equivalent:
(2.8.5)
      • b      = ah for some h in H, or,     a 1 b i s an element of      H,
      • b      is an element of the               left coset a H ,
      • the left cosets a H and bH are equal.
     The number of left cosets of a subgroup is called the index of H in G. The index is
denoted by

(2.8.6)                                       [G :H ].

Thus the index of the subgroup < y > of S3 is 3. When G is infinite, the index may be infinite
too.

Lemma 2.8.7 All left cosets aH of a subgroup H of a group G have the same order.

Proof Multiplication by a defines a map H -+ aH that sends h              ah. This map is bijective
because its inverse is multiplication by a - 1.                                                    □

      Since the cosets all have the same order, and since they partition the group, we obtain
the important Counting Formula

(2.8.8)                                       \G\ = \H \[G :H ]
                        (order o f G) = (order o f H) {number o f cosets),

where, as always, \ G \ denotes the order of the group. The equality has the obvious meaning
if some terms are infinite. For the subgroup <y> of S3, the formula reads 6 = 2           3.
       It follows from the counting formula that the terms on the right side of (2.8.8) divide
the left side. One of these facts is called Lagrange’s Theorem:

Theorem 2.8.9 Lagrange’s Theorem. Let H be a subgroup of a finite group G. The order of
H divides the order of G.                                                                          □

Corollary 2.8.10    The order of an element of a finite group divides the order of the group.
58   Chapter 2      Groups

Proof. The order of an element a of a group G is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup
<a) generated by a (Proposition 2.4.2).                                                           □

Corollary 2.8.11 Suppose that a group G has prime order p. Let a be any element of G
other than the identity. Then G is the cyclic group <a> generated by a.

Proof. The order of an element a*" 1 is greater than 1 and it divides the order of G, which
is the prime integer p. So the order of a is equal to p. This is also the order of the cyclic
subgroup < a > generated by a. Since G has order p, < a > = G.                                □
This corollary classifies groups of prime order p. They form one isomorphism class, the class
of the cyclic groups of order p.                                     '
     The counting formula can also be applied when a homomorphism cp: G -+ G' is given.
As we have seen (2.7.15), the left cosets of the kernel kercp are the nonempty fibres of the
map cp. They are in bijective correspondence with the elements of the image.
(2.8.12)                               [G:kercp] =|im cp|.

Corollary 2.8.13   Let cp:G -+ G ' be a homomorphism of finite groups. Then
      • |G | = |kercp| • |im cp|,
      • |kercp| divides |G |, and
      • |im cp| divides both |G | and |G '|

Proof The first formula is obtained by combining (2.8.8) and (2.8.12), and it implies that
Ikercpl and |im cp| divide |G|. Since the image is a subgroup of G', Lagrange’s theorem tells
us that its order divides | G' | too.                                                         □
      For example, the sign homomorphism (f: Sn ^             {±1} (2.5.2)(b) is surjective, so its
image has order 2. Its kernel, the alternating group An, has order \n \. Half of the elements
of Sn are even permutations, and half are odd permutations.
      The Counting Formula 2.8.8 has an analogue when a chain of subgroups is given.

Proposition 2.8.14 Multiplicative Property of the Index. Let G           H     K be subgroups of
a group G. Then [G : K] = [G: H ][H : K].

Proof We will assume that the two indices on the right are finite, say [G : H] = m and
[H: K] = n. The reasoning when one or the other is infinite is similar. We list the m cosets
of H in G, choosing representative elements for each coset, say as giH , . . . , gmH. Then
81 H U • ■■ U gm H is a partition of G. Similarly, we choose representative elements for each
coset of K in H , obtaining a partition H = h iK U ■ • • U hnK. Since multiplication by gi is
an invertible operation, g ,H = g ih \K U- • ■ U g;hnK will be a partition of the coset giH .
Putting these partitions together, G is partitioned into the m n cosets gjhj K.               □

Right Cosets
Let us go back to the definition of cosets. We made the decision to work with left cosets a R .
One can also define right cosets of a subgroup H and repeat the above discussion for them.
                                                                         Section 2.8      Cosets   59

The right cosets of a subgroup H of a group G are the sets
(2.8.15)                               Ha = {ha \ h e H }.
They are equivalence classes for the relation (right congruence)
                              a = b if b = ha, for some h in H.
Right cosets also partition the group G, but they aren’t always the saine as left cosets. For
instance, the right cosets of the subgroup < y > of S3 are
(2.8.16)        H = {l, y} = H y,     Hx = {x, x2y} = H x2y , Hx2 = {x2, xy} = H xy.
This isn’t the same as the partition (2.8.4) into left cosets. However, if a subgroup is normal,
its right and left cosets are equal.

Proposition 2.8.17     Let H be a subgroup of a group           G. The following conditions are
equivalent:
  (i) H is a normal subgroup: For all h in H and all g in G, ghg- 1 is in H.
 (ii) For all g in G, gH g- 1 = H.
(iii) For all g in G, the left coset gH is equal to the right coset Hg.
(iv) Every left coset of H in G is a right coset.

Proof The notation gH g-1 stands for the set of all elements ghg-1, with h in H.
       Suppose that H is normal. So (i) holds, and it implies that gH g-1 C H for all g in G.
Substituting g- 1 for g shows that g-1 Hg C H as well. We multiply this inclusion on the left
by g and on the right by g- 1 to conclude that H C g H g -1. Therefore gH g- 1 = H. This
shows that (i) implies (ii). It is clear that (ii) implies (i). Next, if g Hg- 1 = H, we multiply
this equation on the right by g to conclude that g H = H g. This shows th at (ii) implies (iii).
One sees similarly that (ii) implies (ii). Since (iii) implies (iv) is obvious, it remains only to
check that (iv) implies (iii).
       We ask: Under what circumstances can a left coset be equal to a right coset? We recall
that the right cosets partition the group G, and we note that the left coset g H and the right
coset H g have an element in common, namely g = g . 1 = 1 . g. So if the left coset gH is
equal to any ri ght coset, that coset must be Hg.                                                  □

Proposition 2.8.18
(a) If H is a subgroup of a group G and g is an element of G, the set gH g- 1 is also a
    subgroup.
(b) If a group G has just one subgroup H of order r, then that subgroup is normal.

Proof (a) Conjugation by g is an automorphism of G (see (2.6.4)), and gH g- 1 is the image
of H. (b) See (2.8.17): gH g- 1 is a subgroup of order r.                                          □
Note: If H is a subgroup of a finite group G, the counting formulas using right cosets or left
cosets are the same, so the number of left cosets is equal to the number of right cosets. This
is also true when G is infinite, though the proof can’t be made by counting (see Exercise
M.8).                                                                                          □

2.9   MODULAR ARITHMETIC
This section contains a brief discussion of one of the most important concepts in number
theory, congruence of integers. If you have not run across this concept before, you will want
to read more about it. See, for instance, [Stark]. We work with a fixed positive integer n
throughout the section.
• Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n

(2.9.1)                                  a == b modulo n,

if n divides b — a, or if b = a + n k for some integer k. For instance, 2 == 17 modulo 5.
       It is easy to check that congruence is an equivalence relation, so we may consider
the equivalence classes, called congruence classes, that it defines. We use bar notation, and
denote the congruence class of an integer a modulo n by the symbol a. This congruence
class is the set of integers
(2.9.2)                   a = { . .. , a — n, a, a + n , a + 2n, . . . }.

If a and b are integers, the equation a = b means that a == b modulo n, or that n divides
b — a. The congruence class 0 is the subgroup
                      0 = Zn = { . . . , -n , 0, n, 2n, . . . } = {kn I k e Z}
of the additive group Z+. The other congruence classes are the cosets of this subgroup.
Please note that Zn is not a right coset - it is a subgroup of Z+. The notation for a coset of
a subgroup H analogous to aH , but using additive notation for the law of composition, is
a + H = {a + h | h e H}. To simplify notation, we denote the subgroup Zn by H. Then
the cosets of H , the congruence classes, are the sets

(2.9.3)                            a + H = { a + kn I k e Z}.
The n integers 0,1, . .. , n — 1 are representative elements for the n congruence classes.

Proposition 2.9.4 There are n congruence classes modulo          n, namely 0, 1, ... , n — 1. The
index [Z: Zn] of the subgroup Zn in Z is n.                                                    □

       Let a and b be congruence classes represented by integers a and b. Their sum is defined
to be the congruence class of a + b, and their product is the class of ab. In other words, by
definition,
(2.9.5)                          a+b=a+b           and ab — ab.

This definition needs some justification, because the same congruence class can be repre­
sented by many different integers. Any integer a' congruent to          a modulo n represents the
same class as a does. So it had better be true that if a' == a and b' == b, then a' + b' == a + b
and a'b' == ab. Fortunately, this is so.

Lemma 2.9.6       If d == a and b' == b modulo n, then d + b’ == a + b and             a'b'==ab
modulo n.
                                              Section 2.10       The Correspondence Theorem        61

Proof. Assume that a' = a and b' = b, so that a' = a + rn and b ' = b + sn for some
integers r and s. Then a' + b' = a + b + (r + s)n. This shows that a ' + b '= a + b. Similarly,
a'b' = (a + rn) (b + sn) = ab + (as + rb + rns)n, so a'b' = ab.                                 □

     The associative, commutative, and distributive laws hold for addition and multiplication
of congruence classes because they hold for addition and multiplication of integers. For
example, the distributive law is verified as follows:

       a(b + c) = a(b + (b+e) = a(b + c)     (definition o f + and Xfor congruence classes)
                = ab + ac                    (distributive law in the integers)
                = ab + ac = ab + a c         (definition o f + and Xfor congruence classes).

The verifications of other laws are similar, and we omit them.
      The set of congruence classes modulo n may be denoted by any one of the symbols
Z /Z n, Z /nZ, or Z /(n ) . Addition, subtraction, and multiplication in Z/Zn can be made
explicit by working with integers and taking remainders after division by n. That is what the
formulas (2.9.5) mean. They tell us that the map

(2.9.7)                                     Z -+ Z/Zn

thatsends an integer a to its congruence class a is compatible with addition and multiplication.
Therefore computations can be made in the integers and then carried over to Z /Z n at the
end. However, computations are simpler if the numbers are kept small. This can be done by
computing the remainder after some part of a computation ha^been made.
      Thus ifn =_29, so that Z /Z n = {0, T, 2, ... , 28}, then (35)(17 + 7) can be computed
as 35 . 24 = 6 . (-:5) = -30 = -1.
      In the long run, the bars over the numbers become a nuisance. They are often left off.
When omitting bars, one just has to remember this rule:

(2.9.8)               To say a = b in Z/Z n means that a = b modulo n.

     Congruences modulo a prime integer have special properties, which we discuss at the
beginning of the next chapter.

2.10      THE CORRESPONDENCE THEOREM
Let <P: G -+ Q be a group homomorphism, and let H be a subgroup of G. We may restrict
to H , obtaining a homomorphism

(2.10.1)                                   CPIn:tf --+ g.

This means that we take the same map    but restrict its domain: So by definition, if h is in
H, then [<p| H](h) = <p(h). (We’ve added brackets around the symbol <P|# for clarity.) The
restriction is a homomorphism because  is one, and the kernel of <P|H is the intersection of
the kernel of      with H:

(2.10.2)                           ker (<p|h ) = (ker<p) n H .
62   Chapter 2      Groups

This is clear from the definition of the kernel. The image of <p|   h is the same as the image
<p(H) of H under the map <p.
      The Counting Formula may help to describe the restriction. According to Corollary
(2.8.13), the order of the image divides both |H | and |9|. If |H | and |9| have no common
factor, <p(H) = {l}, so H is contained in the kernel.

Example 2.10.3 The image of the sign homomorphism (f: Sn ^ { ± I} has order 2. If a
subgroup H of the symmetric group Sn has odd order, it will be contained in the kernel
of a, the alternating group An of even permutations. This will be so when H is the cyclic
subgroup generated by a permutation q that is an element of odd order in the group. Every
permutation whose order in the group is odd, such as an n-cycle with n odd, is an even
permutation. A permutation that has even order in the group may be odd or even.           □

Proposition 2.10.4 Let       : G -+ 9 be a homomorphism with kernel K and let H be a
subgroup of g. Denote the inverse image <p-* ('H) by H. Then H is a subgroup of G that
contains K. If H is a normal subgroup of g, then H is a normal subgroup of G. If     is
surjective and if H is a normal subgroup of G, then H is a normal subgroup of 9.

For example, let     denote the determinant homomorphism GLn(lR) -+          ]RX. The set of
positive real numbers is a subgroup of JRX; it is normal because Kx is abelian. Its inverse
image, the set of invertible matrices with positive determinant, is a normal subgroup of
G L „(K ).
Proof. This proof is simple, but we must keep in mind that <p-1 is not a map. By definition,
<p-! (H) = H is the set of elements x of G such that <p(x) is in H. First, if x is in the kernel
 K, then <p(x) = 1. Since 1 is in H, x is in H. Thus H con tains K. We verify the conditions
for a subgroup.
Closure: Suppose that x and y are in H . Then <p(x) and        (y) are in H. Since H is a subgroup,
<p(x)<p(y) is in H. Since is a homomorphism, <p(x)<p(y) = <p(xy). So <p(xy) is in H, and
xy is in H.
Identity. 1 is in H because <p(1) = 1 is in H.
Inverses: Let x be an element of H. Then         (x) is in 'H, and since 'H is a subgroup, <p(x)-1
is also in H. Since is a homomorphism, <p(x)-1 = <p(x-1), so <p(x-1) is in H, and x - 1 is
in H.
       Suppose that H is a normal subgroup. Let x and g be elements of H and G, respec­
tively. Then <p(gxg-J) = <p(g)<p(x)<p(g)-1 is a conjugate of <p(x) , and <p(x) is in 'H. Because
'H is normal, <p(gxg-1) is in H, and therefore gxg-1 is in H.
       Suppose that     is surjective, and that H is a normal subgroup of G. Let a be in
H, and let b be in Q. There are elements x of H and y of G                     such that <p(x) = a
and <p(y) = b. Since H is normal, yxy- 1 is in H, and therefore <p(yxy-J) = bab- 1 is
m H.                                                                                                □

Theorem 2.10.5 Correspondence Theorem. Let            : G -+ 9 be a surjective group homo­
morphism with kernel K. There is a bijective correspondence between subgroups of 9 and
subgroups of G that contain K:
                  {subgroups of G that contain K} <— > {subgroups of g}.
                                              Section 2.10      The Correspondence Theorem          63

This corresponde nce is defined as follows:
           a subgroup H of G that contains K           its image (fJ(ll) in g,
                              a subgroup      o f9     its inverse image (fJ- 1 (1i) in G.

If H and     are corresponding subgroups, then H is normal in G if and only if               is normal
in g.
If H and     are corresponding subgroups, then |H | = |1i||K |.

Example 2.10.6 We go back to the homomorphism (fJ: S4 -)0 S 3 that was defined in Example
2.5.13, and its kernel K (2.5.15).
      The group S3 has six subgroups, four of them proper. With the usual presentation,
there is one proper subgroup o f order 3, the cyclic group <x>, and there are three subgroups
of order 2, including < y). The Correspondence Theorem tells us that there are four proper
subgroups of S4 that contain K. Since |K | = 4, there is one subgroup of order 12 and there
are three of order 8.
      We know a subgroup of order 12, namely the alternating group A 4. That is the subgroup
that corresponds to the cyclic group <x> of S3.
       The subgroups of ord er 8 can be explain ed in terms of symmetries of a square. With
vertices of the square labeled as in the figure below, a counterclockwise rotation through
the angle 1 C/ 2 corresponds to the 4-cycle (12 34). Reflection about the diagonal through the
vertex 1 corresponds to th e transposition (24). These two permutations generate a subgroup
of order 8. The other subgroups of order 8 can be obtained by labeling the vertices in
other ways.




     There are also some subgroups of S4 that do not contain K. The Correspondence
Theorem has nothing to say about those subgroups.                                  □

P roofof the Correspondence Theorem.      Let H be a subgroup of G that contains K, and let
   be a subgroup of g. We must check the following points:

      • (fJ(ll) is a subgroup of g.
      • (fJ-!(1i) is a subgroup of G, and it contains K.
      •    is a normal subgroup of 9 if and only if (fJ-1 (1i) is a normal subgroup of G.
      • (bijectivity o f the correspondence) (fJ((fJ_1(1i) ) = and (fJ-*((fJ(ll)) = H.
      • |(fJ-l (1i)| = |1i||K|.

Since (fJ(ll) is the image of the homomorphism (fJ|#, it is a subgroup of g. The second and
third bullets form Proposition 2.10.4.
       Concerning the fourth bullet, the equality (fJ((fJ_1(1i)) =      is true for any surjective
map of sets (fJ: S -)0 S' and any subset      of S'. Also, H C (fJ_1((fJ(ll)) is true for any map
64     Chapter 2     Groups

rp of sets and any subset H of S. We omit the verification of these facts. Then the only
thing remaining to be verified is that H :: rp_ l(rp(Il)). Let x be an element of rp-!(rp(.H)).
We must show that x is in H. By definition of the inverse image, rp(x) is in rp(ll), say
rp(x) = rp(a), with a in H . Then a~lx is in the kernel K (2.5.8), and since H contains K,
a~1x is in H. Since both a and a -1x are in H, x is in H too.
      We leave the proof of the last bullet as an exercise.                                     □

2.11    PRODUCT GROUPS
Let G , G' be two groups. The product set G X G ', the set of pairs of elements (a, a') with
a in G and a ' in G ', can be made into a group by component-wise multiplication - that is,
multiplication of pairs is defined by the rule
(2.11.1)                           (a, d ) • (b, b ) = (ab, d b ').

The pair (1, 1) is the identity, and the inverse of (a, a ' is (a -1, a d  ). The associative law in
G X G' follows from the fact that it holds in G and in G'.
      The group obtained in this way is called the product of G and G ' and is denoted by
G X G ' It is related to the two factors G and G' in a simple way that we can sum up in terms
of some homomorphisms
                                     G    .                     G
                                                           P
                                                  GxG' :

(2.11.2)                             G        V            P    G'                   .

They are defined by V(x) = (x, 1),          i'(x') = (1, x'),    p(x, x') = x,    p '(x , x') = X. The
injective homomorphisms i and V may be used to identify G and G ' with their images, the
subgroups G X 1 and 1 x G ' of G x G'. The maps p and p ' are surjective, the kernel of p is
1 x G', and the kernel of p ' is G x 1. These are the projections.
       It is obviously desirable to decompose a given group G as a product, that is, to find
groups H and H ' such that G is isomorphic to the product H X H'. The groups H and H '
^ 1 be simpler, and the relation between H X H ' and its factors is easily understood. It is
rare that a group is a product, but it does happen occasionally.
       For example, it is rather surprising that a cyclic group of order 6 can be decomposed:
A cyclic group C6 of order 6 is isomorphic to the product C 2 X C 3 of cyclic groups of orders
2 and 3. To see this, say that C2 = <y> and C 3 = <z>, with y2 = 1 and z3 = 1, and let x
denote the element (y, z) of the product group C2 X C3. The smallest positive integer k such
that x k = (yk, z*) is the identity (1,1) is k =       6 . So x has order 6. Since C2 X C3 also has
order 6, it is equal to the cyclic group <x>. The powers of x, in order, are
                        (1, 1), (y, z), (1, z2), (y, l),       Q, z),   (y, z2).                    □
      There is an analogous statement for a cyclic group of order rs, whenever the two
integers r and s have no common factor.

Proposition 2.11.3 Let r and s be relatively prime integers. A cyclic group of order rs is
isomorphic to the product of a cyclic group of order r and a cyclic group of order s.               □
                                                               Section 2.11   Product Groups      65

On the other hand, a cyclic group of order 4 is not isomorphic to a product of two cyclic
groups of order 2. Every element of Cz X Cz has order 1 or 2, whereas a cyclic group of order
4 contains two elements of order 4.
      The next proposition describes product groups.

Proposition 2.11.4 Let H and K be subgroups of a group G, and let f : H X K -+ G be the
multiplication map, defined by f(h ,k ) = hk. Its image is the set H K = {hk|h E H, k E K].
(a) f is injective if and only if H n K = {l}.
(b) f is a homomorphism from the product group H X K to G ifand only if elements of K
    commute with elements of H: hk = kh.
(c) If H is a normal subgroup of G, then H K is a subgroup of G.
(d) f is an isomorphism from the product group H X K to G if and only if H n K = {1},
    H K = G, and also H and K are normal subgroups of G.
It is important to note that the multiplication map may be bijective though it isn’t a group
homomorphism. This happens, for instance, when G = S3, and with the usual notation,
H = < x) and K = < y).
Proof (a) If H nK contains an element x:;t 1, then x      1 is in H, and f ( x 1, x) = 1 = f(1, 1),
so f is not injective. Suppose that H n K = {1}. Let (hi, k\) and (hz, kz) be elements of
H x K such that hiki = hzkz. We multiply both sides of this equation on the left by h         and
on the right by k^1, obtaining kik^1 = hJl hz. The left side is an element of K and the right
side is an element of H. Since H n K = {1}, ki k'21 = h j lh 2 = 1. Then ki = £2, h 1 = h 2 ,
and (hi, ki) = (h2, k2).
(b) Let (h i, ki) and (h2, £2) be elements ofthe product group H x K. The product ofthese
elements in the product group H x K is (h ih 2, £1^2), and f(h ih z , kik2) = h ih 2kik2, while
f(h i, k i)f (h 2, k2) = h ik ih 2k2. These elements are equal if and only if h2ki = k ih 2.
(c) Suppose that H is a normal subgroup. We note that K H is a union of the left cosets
k H with k in K, and that H K is a union of the right cosets Hk. Since H is normal,
kH = Hk, and therefore H K = KH. Closure of H K under multiplication follows, because
H K H K = H H K K = HK. Also, (hk)-1 = k_ih — is in K H = HK . This proves closure of
H K under inverses.
(d) Suppose that H and K satisfy the conditions given. Then f is both injective and surjective,
so it is bijective. According to (b), it is an isomorphism if and only if hk = kh for all h in H
and k in K. Consider the commutator (hkh_i)k_1 = h(kh~ik_1). Since K is normal, the left
side is in K, and since H is normal, the right side is in H. Since H n K = {l}, hkh_1k_1 = 1,
and hk = kh. Conversely, if f is an isomorphism, one may verify the conditions listed in the
isomorphic group H X K instead of in G.                                                          □
      We use this proposition to classify groups of order 4:

Proposition 2.11.5 There are two isomorphism classes of groups of order 4, the class of the
cyclic group C4 of order 4 and the class of the Klein Four Group, which is isomorphic to the
product C 2 X C2 of two groups of order 2.
66     Chapter 2     Groups

Proof Let G be a group of order 4. The order of any element x of G divides 4, so there are
two cases to consi der:
Case 1: G contains an element of order 4. Then G is a cyclic group of order 4.
Case 2: Every element of G except the identity has order 2.
      In this case, x = [ I for every element x of G. Let x and y be two elements of G. Then
xy has order 2, so xy[ _1 y-1 = (xy)(xy) = 1. This shows that x and y commute (2.6.5), and
since these are arbitrary elements, G is abelian. So every subgroup is normal. We choose
distinct elements x and y in G, and we let H and K be the cyclic groups of order 2 that they
generate. Proposition 2.11.4(d) shows that G is isomorphic to the pro duct group H X K.      □

2.12    QUOTIENT GROUPS
In this section we show that a law of composition can be defined on the set of cosets of a
normal subgroup N of any group G. This law makes the set of cosets of a normal subgroup
into a group, called a quotient group.
       Addition of congruence classes of integers modulo n is an example of the quotient
construction. Another familiar example is addition of angles. Every real number represents
an angle, and two real numbers represent the same angle if they differ by an integer multiple
of 21T. The group N of integer multiples of 21T is a subgroup of the additive group lR.+ of real
numbers, and angles correspond naturally to (additive) cosets () + N of N in G. The group
of angles is the quotient group whose elements are the cosets.
       The set of cosets of a normal subgroup N of a group G is often denoted by G / N.
(2.12.1)                         G / N is the set of cosets of N in G.
      When we regard a coset C as an element of the set of cosets, the bracket notation [C]
may be used. If C = aN, we may also use the bar notation to denote the element [C] by a,
and then we would denote the set of cosets by G:
                                             G = G /N .

Theorem 2.12.2 Let N be a normal subgroup of a_group G, and let G denote the set of
cosets of N in G. There is a law of composition on G that makes this set into a group, such
that the map 1T: G ^ G defined by 1T(a) = a is a surjective homomorphism whose kernel
is N.

• The map is often referred to as the canonical map from G to G. The word “canonical”
indicates that this is the only map that we might reasonably be talking about.
       The next corollary is very simple, but it is important enough to single out:

Corollary 2.12.3 Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G, and let G denote the set
of cosets of N in G. Let       :G      G be the canonical homomorphism. Let a i, ... , a* be
elements of G such that the product ai ■ ■ - ak is in N. Then ai ■ ■ - ak = 1.

Proof Let p = ai • . ■ a*. Then p is in N, so 1T (p) = p = 1. Since is a homomorphism,
a\- -ak = p.                                                                         □

Proofof Theorem 2.12.2.     There are several things to be done. We must

      • define a law of composition on G,
      • prove that the law makes G into a group,
      • prove that JT is a surjective homomorphism, and
      • prove that the kernel of JT is N.

We use the following notation: If A and B are subsets of a group G, then A B denotes the
set of products ab:

(2.12.4)             A B = {x e G | x = ab for some a       e A and b   e   B}.

We will call this a product set, though in some other contexts the phrase “product set” refers
to the set A x B of pairs of elements.

Lemma 2.12.5 Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G, and let a N and b N be cosets of
N. The product set (aN )(bN ) is also a coset. It is equal to the coset abN.

     We note that the set (aN )(bN ) consists of all elements of G that can be written in the
form anbn', with n and n' in N.

Proof. Since N is a subgroup, N N = N. Since N is normal, left and right cosets are equal:
N b = bN (2.8.17). The lemma is proved by the following formal manipulation:

                    (aN )(bN ) = a (N b )N = a (b N )N = a b N N = abN.                          □

      This lemma allows us to define multiplication on the set G = G / N. Using the bracket
notation (2.7.8), the definition is this: If C\ and C2 are cosets, then [Ci][C2] = [C1C 2],
Where Ci C2 is the product set. The lemma shows that this product set is another coset. To
compute the product [Ci][C2], take any elements a in Ci and b in C2. Then Ci = aN ,
C 2 = bN , and Ci C2 is the coset ab N that contains ab. So we have the very natural formula

(2.12.6)                      [aN][bN] = [abN]        or   lib = ab.

Then by definition of the map JT in (2.12.2),

(2.12.7)                        JT(a)JT(b) = lib = ab = JT(ab).

The fact that JT is a homomorphism will follow from (2.12.7), once we show that G is a group.
Since the canonical map JT is surjective (2.7.8), the next lemma proves this.

Lemma 2.12.8 Let G be a group, and let Y be a set with a law of composition, both
laws written with multiplicative notation. Let cp : G -> Y be a surjective map with the
homomorphism property, that cp(ab) = cp(a)cp(b) for all a and b in G. Then Y is a group
and cp is a homomorphism.
68   Chapter 2       Groups

Proof The group axioms that are true in G are carried over to Y by the surjective map q;.
Here is the proof of the associative law: Let yi, y 2, Y3 be elements of Y. Since q; is surjective,
Yi = q;(xi) for some Xi in G. Then

           (yiY2) Y3 = (q;(Xi)q;(*2))q;(X3)=q;(X!X2)q;(X3)=q;((XiX2)X3)
                    = q;(Xi (X2X3» ) = q;(Xi)q;(X2X3)=q;(Xi)(q;(X2)q;(X3)) = yi (Y2Y3).

The equality marked with an asterisk is the associative law in G. The other equalities follow
from the homomorphism property of q;. The verifications of the other group axioms are
similar.                                                                                      □

      The only thing remaining to be verified is that the kernel of the homomorphism n is
the subgroup N. Well, n (a ) = n (l) if and only if     = 1, or [aN] = [IN], and this is true if
and only if a is an element of N.                                                              □




(2.12.9)                 A Schematic Diagram of Coset Multiplication.

Note: Our assumption that N be a normal subgroup of G is crucial to Lemma 2.12.5. If H
is not normal, there will be left cosets Ci and C 2 of H in G such that the product set C iC 2
does not lie in a single left coset. Going back once more to the subgroup H = <y> of S3,
the product set (lH )(x H ) contains four elements: {I, y}{x, xy} = {x, xy, x2y, x2}. It is not
a coset. The subgroup H is not normal.                                                          □
     The next theorem relates the quotient group construction to a general group homo­
morphism, and it provides a fundamental method of identifying quotient groups.

Theorem 2.12.10 First Isomorphism Theorem. Let_q; : G         G' be a surjective group
homomorphism with kernel N. The quotient group G = G / N is isomorphic to the image
G'. To be precise, let n : G -> G be the canonical map. There is a unique isomorphism
( j: G -*■ G' such that q; = (j 0 n.

Proof. The elements of G are the cosets of N, and they are also the fibres of the map cp
(2.7.15). The m ap qi referred to in the theorem is the one that sends a nonempty fibre to
its image: qi(x) = cp(x). For any surjective map of sets cp: G -+ G', one can form the set
G of fibres, and then one obtains a diagram as above, in which (j is the bijective map that
sends a fibre to its image. When cp is a group homomorphism, qi is an isomorphism because
qi(ab) = cp(ab) = cp(a)cp(b) = qi(a)qi(b).                                                  □

Corollary 2.12.11 Let cp: G -+ G' be a group homomorphism with kernel N and image H'.
The quotient group G = G /N is isomorphic to the image H .                                              □

      Two quick examples: The image of the absolute value map Cx -+ Kx is the group
of positive real numbers, and its kernel is the unit circle V. The theorem asserts that the
quotient group Cx/ U is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers.
The determinant is a surjective homomorphism G L n (R) -+ Mx, whose kernel is the special
linear group SLn (X). So the quotient GLn(M )/ SLn(K) is isomorphic to Mx.
      There are also theorems called the Second and the Third Isomorphism Theorems,
though they are less important.

M.16. 1(the homophonic group: a mathematical diversion) By definition, English words have
      the same pronunciation if their phonetic spellings in the dictionary are the same. The
      homophonic group is generated by the letters of the alphabet, subject to the following
      relations: English words with the same pronunciation represent equal elements of the
      group. Thus be = bee, and since     is a group, we can cancel be to conclude that e = 1.
      Try to determine the group ft.
